        title: "Student, MUT",
        testimony: "If you happen to be in a business or marketing related major, joining one of these clubs will expose you to how applications are made. Although solicitations to join your start-up or requests to sign a NDA will be met with some rejection. If you have a passion for business and your idea, you should have enough to learn how to make it. Trust me, as long as you have a interest to learn- they will have open arms especially if you teach them how to pitch. I found that now more than ever, the expanse of information of multiple groups of varying disciplines is too valuable to be ignored in sectarian divide between majors."
